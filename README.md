# Overview
Applying several different models(naive bayes, logistic regression(binary and multi-class), neural network made from scratch to solve a bird classification problem. While the data-set is preprocessed by the creator of the data-set it's still very a noisy background.
This has led to low learning rate to the models, with the nueral network model being highest around 48% +- 4%(random weights lead to some variance in results).
